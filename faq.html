# Permissions

## `webRequest`
Needed to be able to check the headers of the pages you visit, which helps us
determine certain open source libraries like what server websites may be
running, frameworks, or programming languages.

This one is important because there are ways where we can artifically determine
this by re-requesting the page you're on, and checking those headers.

However doing this is risky, and while some other extensions use this approach,
this can cause serious security issues (eg. re-submitting requests on poorly
designed financial websites).

## `cookies`
Used in determining things like:  
- Programming frameworks

## `tabs`
Used to load Matlock up in all your tabs once it's installed.

## `storage`
Used to speed up Matlock so that we don't need to re-investigate webpages
that may have been investigated earlier.

## `<all_urls>`
